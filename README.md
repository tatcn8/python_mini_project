# Ted's Python Mini Project

## The App
This app is a financial data app, honestly it doesn't have a ton of helpful function (it won't calculate anything) BUT it has full CRUD functionality and does a great job of storing past financial data.

## Technology Used
Django and Python 

## Noteworthy
This app has user authentication, which I am really proud of. Users must signup then login in order to use the App. Users may view ONLY their financial data, which is obviously important. The deployment was oddly unsuccessful as I got stuck with an odd "pyscopg2" error; and was unable to solve it. Everything went smoothly when I deployed a similar django app (tunr) the other day; so I really have no clue, and honestly it was kind of disappointing.
